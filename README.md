Bingo!
=====

A simple bingo game using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), Compass, Grunt, Bootstrap and various other bits and pieces. Feel free to mess about with it.

To install and use this, start by following the [Getting Started](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) instructions on the Yeoman site - it's easy. Then pull this repo, open up a console and type 'grunt serve', and off you go :-)
